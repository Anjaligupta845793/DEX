# Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Platform

## Assignment Overview
This project involves the development of a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform that allows users to add liquidity, swap tokens, and remove liquidity from pools. The platform is built on the Polygon Amoy testnet.

## Features
- **Add Liquidity**: Users can add tokens to liquidity pools to earn rewards.
- **Token Swapping**: Users can swap between different ERC-20 tokens directly from their wallets.
- **Remove Liquidity**: Users can withdraw their tokens from liquidity pools.

## Deliverables
- Smart contracts implementing the DEX functionality.
- Comprehensive test cases to ensure contract reliability.
- Deployment on the Polygon Amoy testnet.
- Complete README documentation.
